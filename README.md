# Switching_to_CachyOS

A log for everything I have done to fully switch from Windows 10 to CachyOS on
my main PC for both gaming and productivity.

Also check out KyloNeko's
[fantastic guide](https://codeberg.org/KyloNeko/Linux-Guide-to-Vtubing), which
is more geared towards VTubers, but still contains many basic information that
could help almost anyone who wants to switch to Linux from Windows.
